# ðŸ§µ Multithreading Classical Problems

This repository contains implementations of **classical multithreading and synchronization problems** in C++ (and Python for semaphore).  
Each problem demonstrates the use of threads, mutex, condition variables, and semaphores with practical examples and outputs.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

1. **Multiple Threads Execution**  
   - Basic example of running multiple threads concurrently.  

2. **Critical Section & Race Condition**  
   - Demonstrates how race conditions occur when multiple threads access shared data.  

3. **Mutex Example**  
   - Shows how to use a mutex to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety.  

4. **Conditional Variable**  
   - Uses a mutex and condition variable to signal between threads.  

5. **Semaphore Example (Python)**  
   - Implementation of semaphore to control access to shared resources.  

6. **Producerâ€“Consumer Problem**  
   - Classic synchronization problem solved using mutex and condition variable.  

7. **Readerâ€“Writer Problem**  
   - Demonstrates synchronization between readers and writers accessing shared data.  

8. **Dining Philosophers Problem**  
   - Illustrates deadlock avoidance and synchronization using mutex.
